## Features

The Project Azuga Training has codes for different applications like,

1-Linux-commands: The project contains programs that mimics some of the basic Linux-Commands like cat, wc, head, tail, sort, ls etc

2-Api-Calls: It is included with programs for major Api's GET methods to get the data from the Api's and use them to create the .csv and .json files.

3-File-Formatting: The data from the Api's Call method stored in .csv and .json file are formatted to the .xml, .pdf, .html formats.

4-Charts Creation: The Api's data in the files are used to create the charts, i.e to visualize the properties of the Api. Bar chart, Pie Chart and Line Chart are created.

5-OOPs Concepts: OOps concepts like interface, methods, objects, classes, constructors, abstraction etc were also used in the java codes.

6-Zip And UnZip: The reports created from the Api calls and Formatters were zipped, unzipped and sent through the mail programatically using java language.
